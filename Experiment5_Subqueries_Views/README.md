# Experiment 5: Subqueries and Views

## AIM
To study and implement subqueries and views.

## THEORY

### Subqueries
A subquery is a query inside another SQL query and is embedded in:
- WHERE clause
- HAVING clause
- FROM clause

**Types:**
- **Single-row subquery**:
  Sub queries can also return more than one value. Such results should be made use along with the operators in and any.
- **Multiple-row subquery**:
  Here more than one subquery is used. These multiple sub queries are combined by means of ‘and’ & ‘or’ keywords.
- **Correlated subquery**:
  A subquery is evaluated once for the entire parent statement whereas a correlated Sub query is evaluated once per row processed by the parent statement.

**Example:**
```sql
SELECT * FROM employees
WHERE salary > (SELECT AVG(salary) FROM employees);
```
### Views
A view is a virtual table based on the result of an SQL SELECT query.
**Create View:**
```sql
CREATE VIEW view_name AS
SELECT column1, column2 FROM table_name WHERE condition;
```
**Drop View:**
```sql
DROP VIEW view_name;
```

**Question 1**
--
From the following tables write a SQL query to find all orders generated by London-based salespeople. Return ord_no, purch_amt, ord_date, customer_id, salesman_id.


```sql
SELECT o.ord_no, o.purch_amt, o.ord_date, o.customer_id, o.salesman_id
FROM orders o
JOIN salesman s ON o.salesman_id = s.salesman_id
WHERE s.city = 'London';

```

**Question 2**
---
Write a SQL query to retrieve all columns from the CUSTOMERS table for customers whose salary is LESS than $2500.

Sample table: CUSTOMERS

7           Muffy          24              Indore            10000

```sql
SELECT *
FROM CUSTOMERS
WHERE SALARY < 2500;

```

**Output:**

FROM Orders
WHERE salesman_id IN (
    SELECT salesman_id
    FROM Orders
    WHERE customer_id = 3007
);

```

**Output:**
